# dotfiles
New (and hopefully more organized) dotfiles on Arch Linux. Wayland-based configuration. Inspired by [Kitty Desert Theme](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes/blob/master/themes/Desert.conf).

## Setup
Some basic information about my setup.
- OS: Arch Linux
- Window Manager: Sway
- Terminal: kitty
- Shell: Bash (to be replaced by zsh)
- Text Editor: Neovim

### Install?
No, I don't think so.

## Serious To Do
- [ ] Wifi Setup (Eduroam)
- [ ] Get Bluetooth to work with headphones

## Cool Stuff
Screenshots when I'm done.
