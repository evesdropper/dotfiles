# dotfiles

## Note

If you're looking for the LuaSnip Guide: [https://evesdropper.dev/files/luasnip/](website) or [readme](https://github.com/evesdropper/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim/luasnip)

New (and hopefully more organized) dotfiles on Arch Linux. Wayland-based configuration.

## Setup
Some basic information about my setup.
- OS: Arch Linux
- Window Manager: Sway
- Terminal: kitty
- Shell: Bash (to be replaced by zsh)
- Text Editor: Neovim

### Install?
No, I don't think so.

## Serious To Do
- [ ] System: Wifi Setup (Eduroam)
- [ ] System: Get Bluetooth to work with headphones
- [ ] System: Get zsh env to be the same as bash, then configure stuff.
- [ ] LaTeX: update preamble.
- [ ] Neovim: configure current plugins (nvim-tree, commment, bufferline). 
- [ ] General (Neovim/LuaSnip): add development plugins (e.g. toggleterm) and create snippets/commands/keybinds for software development.
- [ ] Waybar: Add Google Calendar integration.

## Cool Stuff
Screenshots when I'm done.

## Serious Stuff
Startpage is a clone of [hawk](https://github.com/itsvs/hawk) with some personal changes added.
