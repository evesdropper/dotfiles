# dotfiles (thinkpad edition)

Basically like dotfiles on my current computer, but with a commitment to try to make things slightly less suspicious than last time. Still a Wayland-based configuration.

## Setup
Some basic information about my setup. Pretty much the same as before but possible that changes may be made. Also added a Thinkpad bit for reading enjoyment.

### Thinkpad

Thinkpad T430, with the following modifications:
- CPU modded to i7â€“3840QM
- RAM to 16GB DDR3L, 2 1TB drives
- T420 keyboard for the vibes
- WQHD Display Upgrade

### Arch
- OS: Arch Linux
- Window Manager: Sway
    * Status Bar: Waybar
    * Screen Lock: gtklock
- Terminal: kitty
- Shell: zsh
- File Manager: lf
- Text Editor: Neovim
- Web Browser: A mix of qutebrowser and hardened Firefox (modified with [Narsil's `user.js`](https://codeberg.org/Narsil/user.js) and [Cascade](https://github.com/cascadefox/cascade))

Essentially just me reading the entirety of [definitive T430 modding guide](https://medium.com/@n4ru/the-definitive-t430-modding-guide-3dff3f6a8e2e) and [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/nc1bk6/t430_wqhd_ips_upgrade_and_hsf_mod/) and then throwing money away in the sillest ways possible.

## Install

Maybe. My whole entire system is so much cleaner.
